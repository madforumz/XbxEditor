The File Allocation Table is a series of addresses that is accessed as a lookup table
to see which cluster comes next, when loading a file or traversing a directory. For
example, if the system had just loaded cluster 23, it would look up offset 23 in the
FAT and the address there would be that of the next cluster; typically 24. Because
the FAT is such a vital data structure, there are typically two copies (i.e. FAT1 and
FAT2) so that corruption of the FAT can be detected and hopefully intelligently
repaired.

The root directory is fixed in length and always located at the start of the volume
(after the FAT) in FAT12 and FAT16 volumes, but FAT32 treats the root directory as
just another cluster chain in the data area. However, even in FAT32 volumes, the root
directory will typically follow imediately after the two FATs.

The data area fills the rest of the volume, and is divided into clusters; it is here
that the file data is stored. Subdirectories are files with a particular structure
that is understood by the file system, and are marked as being directories rather
than files by setting the "directory" attribute bit in the directory entry that
points to it.
